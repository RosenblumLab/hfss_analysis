- If the error log has `COM` in it, it is an ANSYS error. Look for it directly in HFSS.

- Make sure ANSYS is open before running your code. It is also better if your project is the only one open during the run.

- Sweeping using an HFSS project that is saved in Dropbox sometimes crashes due to synchronization issues. Try to download it and run locally instead.
