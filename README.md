# HFSS&pyEPR-examples

This repository contains some exaples of HFSS designs and how to simulate them using `pyEPR`.

Analyses can be static, where a single design parameters are calculated, or sweep, where a python loop goes over a parameter (or more) and plots the different results. The latter is useful when choosing design parameters.

The losses folder (and module) calculates predicated quality factors due to different loss channels.
